# High-level Overview

## What is Merlion

The Merlion project is the most decentralized, scalable, and high-throughput blockchain for fractional-algorithmic
stablecoin and various vanward DeFi-specific innovations. It is built
using [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)
. It also enables fully compatibility and interchangeability with Ethereum/EVM based DApps, by embedding the evm module
from [Ethermint](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint).

Absorbed the creations and lessons of some pioneering protocols/projects, the architecture and mechanism of Merlion are
designed to meet the demands of an increasingly diversified multi/cross-chain world. Merlion's tokenomics is elaborately
formulated to not only incentivize early adopters, but also encourage long-term cooperation to grow bigger and stronger.

## Mer and Lion

The merlion system consists of two main native coins, Mer and Lion.

- **Mer**: Stablecoins that track the price of fiat currencies, and they are named for their fiat counterparts. In the
  early stage of the mainnet launch, it will mainly issue **MerUSD**, or **USM**, which tracks/pegs the price of $USD.
- **Lion**: Merlion blockchain's native staking coin that partially absorbs the price volatility of Mer. Users stake
  Lion to validators to add blocks of transactions to the blockchain, and earn various fees and rewards. Holders of Lion
  also can vote on proposals and participate in on-chain governance.

## How the Merlion stablecoin protocol works

### Stablecoin

Like [Terra](https://www.terra.money), Merlion is also a DeFi-specific blockchain with built-in algorithmic stablecoin
protocol. But the difference is that Merlion does not rely on any purely algorithmic design which is difficult to grow
and exhibits extreme periods of volatility. Merlion stablecoin is named **Mer**. is fractional-algorithmic (This term
comes from [Frax](https://frax.finance)) and will be minted in two ways.

The first is with parts of its backing assets and parts of the algorithmic supply. The ratio of backing and algorithmic
depends on the market's pricing of the Mer stablecoin.

The second is over collateralized and interest-bearing lending.
